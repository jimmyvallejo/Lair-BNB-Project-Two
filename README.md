-- Vanilla JavaScript with Css/Html and express/MongoDb.

--I built this project in order to practice my backend development skills and the intereaction between the backend and the frontend.

--I learned how to set up routes both post and get routes as well as how to query your database for all items on a collection, specific items in a collection and how to add, edit and remove items from a collection.

-- I also learned how to use backend to built features such as a a search bar and how to get quanity and price for an item from the from the frontend and use STRIPE API on the backend for payment authorization.

-- Gained a stronger understanding of working on a deadline and how to manage my time. Also gained a stronger understanding of how to target bugs, research fixes, and implement fixes in a larger application.
